# PicMapper

This is alpha-level software written in C# that takes georeferenced images and outputs a KMZ file 
showing the location of those images.

## License

This project is licensed under the [MPL version 2.0](LICENSE.md)

## Roadmap

* Get basic functionality to export a KMZ for images
* Use GDAL or something similar to write out other formats (e.g. SHP, GeoPackage, JSON)
* Image manipulations (correct rotations, resize, compress)
